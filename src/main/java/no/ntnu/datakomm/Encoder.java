     * ------------------------------------------------------------
     * The protocol for encoding
     * ------------------------------------------------------------
     * Human-readable message strings are encoded to bit-strings according to the following rules:
     * 1) Only the following characters are allowed in the plain-text, human-readable messages:
     *   - lowercase letters a-z
     *   - uppercase letters A-Z
     *   - digits 0-9
     *   - space ' '
     *   - comma ','
     *   - period '.'
     *   - exclamation mark '!'
     * 2) Each character of the message is translated to an integer code first, by taking the ASCII code of that
     *    character. See ASCII table here: https://www.asciitable.com/
     *    Examples: uppercase letter `A` has ASCII code 65, letter `B` has ASCII code 66, etc.; while lowercase
     *    letter `a` has code 97, lowercase `b` has code 98, etc.
     * 3) Then the integer code is translated to a binary string, always eight bits for each integer code.
     *    The binary string contains the most significant bit first.
     *    Examples: number 65 is translated to "01000001", 66 is translated to "01000010", 98 is translated to
     *    "01100010". Number 0 is translated to "00000000" and number 255 is translated to "11111111".
     * 4) The binary strings for each character are then concatenated in the order as they appear.
     *    Examples:
     *      "ABC" -> 65, 66, 67 -> "010000010100001001000011"
     *      "Hi!" -> 72, 105, 33 -> "010010000110100100100001"
     *
     * Conversion in the opposite direction happens according to the same rules, just in the opposite direction:
     * 1) Split the bit string into 8-character chunks (8-bit blocks)
     * 2) Convert each 8-bit block to an integer
     * 3) Convert the integer to a character, using the ASCII table
     * 4) Only the same limited set of characters is allowed (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, space, comma, period, exclamation mark).
     * If the decoded symbols is not in the allowed character set, an exception must be thrown.
     * 5) Concatenate the individual characters together to form a message
